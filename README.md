# LiteCommerce Microservice Project

## Overview
This is a learning-focused e-commerce project designed to explore and implement the **microservice architecture**. The project is structured to simulate a real-world e-commerce system, providing valuable hands-on experience with distributed systems, service communication, and scalability.

The frontend is built using **Blazor**, providing an interactive and modern single-page application (SPA) experience. The backend consists of several microservices, each responsible for specific business functionalities.

## Goals
- **Learn and Experiment:** This project is primarily aimed at studying and experimenting with microservice architecture.
- **Modularity:** Understand how to break down a complex application into smaller, manageable, and independent services.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Gain insights into designing scalable and maintainable systems.

## Features
The system consists of the following microservices:

### 1. **Catalog Service** (In Progress)
Manages product information including categories, brands, and attributes.
- Product CRUD operations
- Search and filter functionality

### 2. **User Service** (Not Yet Implemented)
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- User roles and permissions
- JWT-based authentication

### 3. **Inventory Service** (Not Yet Implemented)
Tracks and manages stock levels for products.
- Real-time stock updates
- Integration with order processing

### 4. **Order Service** (Not Yet Implemented)
Manages the lifecycle of orders.
- Cart and checkout functionality
- Order tracking and status updates

### 5. **Payment Service** (Not Yet Implemented)
Processes payments securely.

- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### 8. **Promotion and Discount Service** (Not Yet Implemented)
